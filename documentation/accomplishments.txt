Set up the overall blockchain application.

Created the basic building block of the blockchain - with blocks themselves!

Started a test-driven development approach to the project.

Built the genesis block - to get the blockchain going.

Added functionality to mine a block - create a new block for the blockchain.

Developed the important sha-256 hash function.

Applied the hash to mine a block.

Created the fundamental blockchain class.

Developed functionality to validate the blockchain, to allow for chain replacement.

Implemented chain replacement.

Investigated stubbing console output in tests to keep the output clean.

Implemented the proof of work system by adding a difficulty and nonce value to each block.

Adjusted the difficulty for a block to ensure that blocks are mined at a rate which approaches a set mining rate for the system.

Investigated the proof of work system by writing a script which checked how will the dynamic difficulty adjusted the system to approach the mine rate.

Switched the hexadecimal character-based difficulty criteria to a more fine-grained binary bit-based difficulty criteria.

Prevented a potential difficulty jump attack by adding extra validation for the blockchain.
